How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using diff you can compare two different files and as a result you can see 
    what exactly was changed in a file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can always return to the previous version of your program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you decide when the file is ready and commmit it
    Cons: you can lose everything if do not save it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    to have an ability to work with mi\ultiple files that are interconnected with 
    each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --> to find commit id 
    git diff --> to find the differences between two commmits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you always can return to the version where bug was introduced and fix it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to store my python projects
